00:00
welcome back to the profitable Python
00:03
I'm your host Ben McNeal and on this
00:05
episode you will meet alexei gribov
00:09
alexei lives in berlin with his wife and
00:12
son by trade he's a software engineer
00:14
with a focus on machine learning he
00:17
works at OLX group as a lead data
00:20
scientist and some cool facts about
00:22
alexei our he's a kegel master he wrote
00:26
a couple of books one of them called
00:28
mastering Java for data science and the
00:31
other one he's working on right now
00:33
called machine learning book camp and
00:36
that's not a typo it's called book camp
00:38
which was recently recently released as
00:42
a MEAP
00:43
so Alexey welcome to the show pleasure
00:46
to be here
00:46
yes yeah glad to have you and one of the
00:50
first things I want to talk about was
00:52
for those of you that don't know what a
00:54
MEAP is it's early access to the book
00:57
can you can you talk about like the
00:59
benefits that your readers get by
01:00
signing up for the meet right now yeah
01:34
the and I think there's like three
01:36
chapters you can just jump into right
01:38
now cool and this is all machine
01:53
learning hands-on like like zero to hero
01:57
type stuff get your hands super dirty
01:59
with machine learning
02:03
uh-oh go ahead item in unison yes so the
02:06
idea is to to learn by doing solar
02:10
machine learning by doing projects and
02:13
every chapter is a new new project where
02:17
you trying to understand what is data
02:21
set about then machine learning model
02:26
trying to to understand what's going on
02:29
inside the model
02:30
so how long does it make relations what
02:32
is the how we can use this out pretty
02:36
hands-on so I try to keep the theory to
02:38
minimum but sometimes it's not really
02:41
possible because and machine learning is
02:44
supplied with medics
02:45
so they steal the formula or two here
02:48
and there but the focus is pretty much
02:52
get the awesome and I think like the
02:59
last little nugget that I wanted to just
03:01
prompt you with here was all these
03:03
projects are basically designed for
03:05
somebody to go through and have a
03:08
portfolio of machine learning like a
03:12
body of work that they can go on to it's
03:15
kind of catered to like getting a job in
03:17
the industry right they don't know I was
03:30
doing it so they can already code you
03:37
can just do projects cool yeah I'm
03:52
excited to see how that progresses okay
03:56
so when it comes or when machine
03:59
learning becomes fully commoditized what
04:02
will be the areas that software
04:04
engineers will need to specialize in
04:06
because the what the jobs that we're
04:08
applying for right now like might not
04:10
even it might not even be a thing right
04:14
yeah so that's actually indeed a trend
04:19
that machine learning becomes simpler to
04:23
to enter for people who can code so
04:28
right now there are so many libraries
04:29
where you don't need to know all this
04:32
mathematics you can just take some
04:34
off-the-shelf solution and just use it
04:37
one thing is library but there is this
04:40
software as service providers where you
04:43
can just throw in a data set and then it
04:45
will give you so that's pretty cool
04:49
but I don't think it will anyhow make
04:54
the jobs all data scientist or machine
04:57
learning engineers go away because I
05:00
think it just helps them because this
05:02
process of training and models sometimes
05:03
is to use so you need to try to come up
05:07
with the best parameters and things like
05:09
this and just makes a lot of you just
05:12
give it a later and then keeps back
05:15
tomorrow still there are so many things
05:17
around even before then you get the data
05:28
and you prepare that then you can use
05:31
either this service or use a library to
05:36
train the model and there is a lot of
05:38
work after you have tomorrow you need to
05:41
get the models and make it available for
05:44
others to consume or integrated services
05:47
and then actually make these models
05:51
useful so that's a lot of things that
05:55
are not covered by this boxes blank
05:59
boxes where I'll just throw in beta and
06:01
get model so there's a lot of things
06:03
around so I am pretty sure the I have
06:08
job security right now was a data
06:10
scientist because these things are not
06:12
going to be maybe one little step is
06:18
buttressed
06:21
unlikely so we still need people to
06:24
actually do these things
06:25
and many things that these things
06:30
downtown to link is like as I said some
06:34
negative things so something that it's
06:36
fun to do a few times but then if you do
06:38
it for the tenth time or twenty times
06:41
she's actually will think that we have
06:43
these tools now too
06:47
okay and if I'm hearing you correctly
06:50
maybe some areas like if you're not
06:53
aware of the landscape that that's kind
06:56
of out there in order to be an effective
06:58
machine learning professional working
07:01
with models and production and that sort
07:03
of thing like it is it does it make
07:05
sense for that person to basically maybe
07:09
focus a little less on like particular
07:13
models because we have the auto ml's and
07:16
and maybe focus more on like learning
07:19
about the the the business and also like
07:23
running things in production is there
07:26
like special knowledge that you
07:29
recommend that we kind of get by running
07:32
in production or machine learning models
07:36
in production learning so you learn by
08:32
just going live and seen
08:36
trying to tweak it so it doesn't go down
08:38
on a million users and toothpaste this
08:45
is more like traditional software
08:48
engineering work the only welcome Ashley
08:52
Lincoln went there it's just service
08:54
yourself is emotion during stories
08:57
tomorrow still need to learn a lot about
09:00
like how your service should be able to
09:04
sustain this particular workload of
09:08
traffic that your users okay yeah thanks
09:15
for sharing that and I was curious how
09:17
did your early days of IT and in kind of
09:21
your background in databases how did
09:22
that set you up for your chosen path as
09:25
a machine learning expert there was no
10:31
way to so because everybody just needed
10:35
a database then eventually I'm to city
10:41
in central Russia and there I realized
10:45
that
10:46
people don't really need Elfie they need
10:48
Java they need web services they need
10:51
something more interactive but still
10:55
attend it's a database and then just
11:01
service that goes to the base and then
11:06
around 2012 there was like grocery
11:09
became popular and there was machinery
11:14
and I happened to you to watch that
11:17
course and this really changed my life
11:20
away understood ok this is Java is fun
11:24
databases are fun but because I should
11:34
really go around the time positions in
11:41
data science here as well in small
11:45
amounts not like now just a couple here
11:48
in there but then I live in Poland and
11:53
there were a couple of positions
11:59
required like PhD so like experiencing
12:03
Hadoop and things like this it was
12:05
really tough to get companies also
12:07
didn't understand what they want from
12:10
the other side they just heard the key
12:12
this machine learning thing data science
12:14
is also I think let's hire somebody with
12:16
each key and figure out what we need
12:21
yeah so it was really tough to to to
12:24
switch from Java to today the science
12:27
back then so I decided okay maybe I need
12:29
communication so I did a masters and in
12:35
the meantime I also worked mostly
12:39
between some Java but for machine
12:41
learning and then when I created all of
12:46
a sudden they didn't need AG anymore
12:50
they the market figured out what they
12:53
actually need from data scientists so
12:55
they understood that HD is a nice thing
12:58
must and since there is only growing the
13:03
demand for data science language years
13:05
and for me what I found out is having
13:09
background in software engineering is
13:12
super helpful because at the end we have
13:17
a model see but now you need to do
13:20
something with this you need to go to
13:21
production and this is the part where
13:25
many data scientists try to do with
13:27
because they know how to eat paper you
13:29
know how to implement things but going
13:31
to production is difficult so that's why
13:34
I think having some experience in
13:37
exposure to software engineering is
13:40
similar for data scientists actually
13:42
make use of these models and then solve
13:46
the video business problems by
13:49
productionize in machine learning so
13:54
this is and I also noticed that many
13:56
companies are looking for this kind of
13:58
people for software engineers who know
14:01
bit of machine learning maybe not super
14:04
in-depth but enough to actually to train
14:07
a model and make good impact because
14:11
with the skills or software engineers
14:12
they contain a simple models and
14:16
actually make impact by production izing
14:19
integration with existing services and
14:22
[Music]
14:24
yeah that's that's an interesting
14:27
interesting insight there so a little
14:31
counterintuitive I guess yes there's
14:34
been so many time trying to go in-depth
14:37
into math and then at the end it turned
14:40
out that it's not really that needed is
14:42
fun it was fun to really understand how
14:45
these things work but actually the job
14:52
I'm doing the job many of my colleagues
14:53
are doing they don't involve solving
14:55
math equations you just take her library
14:58
take it as I said spends months playing
15:02
with it and take this data set then
15:05
throw it into library wait for 10
15:07
minutes and then productionize it so
15:11
they're part of enduring
15:13
doesn't take a lot of time you get the
15:17
focus of many programs in universities
15:20
and online courses is gone their
15:23
mathematics behind this is I think still
15:27
somehow needed to be able to understand
15:30
what's going on to the same extent a
15:32
software engineer probably should know
15:33
how a TCP works right but not many
15:38
software engineers actually need to to
15:40
go deep into all these TCP stuck to you
15:43
on everyday basis cried maybe once in
15:46
five years there is some problem that
15:48
requires going deep but day to day work
15:53
I think the same happens in motion
15:57
drawing so typically you need you just
16:00
need to have broad knowledge good
16:02
exposure to different techniques but
16:04
maybe knowing all the all the details
16:09
may be helpful just yeah a bit of
16:12
knowledge just a beautiful nation how it
16:14
actually works to be able to explain
16:16
when something is not right to be able
16:19
to understand and debug perhaps but
16:22
maybe going deeper is only needed when
16:25
you face this problem not like I did I
16:31
try to understand all in advance and
16:33
then in mmm I mean that's seriously this
16:46
is the reason why I do the podcast
16:47
because you have mentorship figures like
16:50
yourself that are like hey there's a
16:52
thousand way to do this but if you want
16:54
if you want to have like any kind of
16:55
quality of life this is the path you go
16:57
down so you're like a huge proponent of
17:00
like maybe get some general knowledge
17:03
you know that's not going to be a waste
17:05
but if you're somebody that gets in the
17:06
weeds with things like don't let
17:09
yourself go down these rabbit trails if
17:11
you're trying to make money with your
17:13
skills
17:13
you just need general knowledge and and
17:17
just focus on just put it whatever it
17:20
takes to put it in production it's kind
17:21
of what I'm hearing
17:24
when you like T's like you have like a
17:28
bunch of skills and then you have the
17:31
breadth of these skills and then T's
17:34
like you just touch a few subjects but
17:38
not a few there are many British knives
17:43
in machine learning models preparing the
17:46
services different and services like all
17:50
these kind of things just to know a bit
17:54
of them like for example how to go ahead
17:57
and create a singular in Java this is
18:00
super useful but maybe you don't get as
18:02
machine learning engineering don't need
18:04
to go really deep into understanding how
18:07
a art works on how to make front-end
18:10
applications as a professional front end
18:13
but just having some exposure is helpful
18:16
but when you specialize in some
18:18
particular thing for example like
18:36
knowledge in different areas yeah that
18:40
makes me shallow yes okay that makes
18:42
sense so if if I were to just take here
18:44
a little bit what would be the the depth
18:47
that that we should be seeking as
18:49
machine learning engineers like where's
18:51
our time best Bank going deep would you
18:54
say so I think it depends on what you
18:57
like because what I think is is that
19:04
that goes down for people it's different
19:08
for everyone
19:09
okay so then this diversity of skills
19:13
people who can do you can quickly go
19:16
through for some people it's actually
19:24
just take this niceness
19:25
for some people it's make it so this is
19:32
ingenious make sure that the data is
19:35
processed reliably
19:37
all kind of like it's called eto data
19:43
from somewhere process and store it and
19:45
make it available for elearning services
19:47
to consume and if this T is different
19:50
for people in the team what team can do
19:55
basically everything and if in some
19:58
parts maybe there is not there is not
20:01
expecting the team they still have some
20:04
challenged you to to dig deeper and yeah
20:09
dang that's a cool concept as you were
20:12
describing that I was thinking about
20:13
things at work because I kind of I come
20:15
from a similar background of databases
20:17
like that was my first taste of the you
20:19
know the data world and a lot of my work
20:22
I see myself going back to the data
20:25
engineering side and but you know
20:28
ultimately it's like what can we do to
20:30
support that mission of getting these
20:32
things into production and if I'm the
20:34
database guy and there's like a Linux
20:36
guy that's doing DevOps like this is
20:39
these are good T's to have on your team
20:41
so one thing is creating this release
20:53
and then other thing is actually making
20:55
sure the scaling alerting all these
21:04
things around the material makes it
21:07
production to make sure that all the
21:12
responses within 15 I don't know like 10
21:19
seconds so doesn't exceed this time
21:23
doesn't go down all these things this is
21:26
something that DevOps
21:28
people engineers reliability yes so
21:38
these people are super helpful for teams
21:40
and they aren't very hard to get and
21:42
these people now decide to learn a
21:45
little about machine learning then they
21:47
all of a sudden becomes
21:49
valuable for companies that want you to
21:52
use machine learning to make life
21:55
because they have this unique skills
21:58
that make software reliable they also
22:02
know a bit of machine learning to
22:03
actually understand what's going on so
22:05
this is super helpful yeah dang yeah
22:11
thanks thanks for allowing me to open up
22:14
that can of worms that's that's a that's
22:16
a good information
22:17
I was curious what was your first
22:20
success as a machine learning so when I
23:20
was it's called search matrix so they
23:31
are doing search engine optimization and
23:33
one of the things people are doing was
23:36
helping copywriters copywriters are
23:39
people who need to write look so there
23:43
are basically marketers they want you to
23:45
get the company where they are working
23:48
for a lot of exposure so they go ahead
23:53
and read as many articles as possible so
23:55
these articles get indexed by search
23:57
engines
23:58
when people look for things people read
24:02
this article something end up on the
24:04
company's website and ethics
24:06
so for these contractors the task is
24:09
typically a into right
24:11
I don't know 1000 words on this topic so
24:14
this is the topic do your research and
24:16
then come up with an article the typical
24:20
workflow of copywriters is going google
24:24
type the query they want to optimize for
24:28
they want to create an article for and
24:29
then then understand what are the
24:34
results are whatever talk besides what
24:37
they write about what are the topics the
24:41
cover what are the things they discuss
24:43
and then they analyzes to some research
24:47
and then they come up with a new article
24:49
that sort of reflects what is already
24:52
there that google picked up by this
24:55
keyword they try to produce something
24:57
similar and the idea is if Google found
25:02
the other articles useful and valuable
25:05
so they ended up in the top result this
25:08
new article also would end up in the top
25:10
results and this essentially this is
25:15
actually working
25:16
so this way operators can can produce
25:20
content in total but there's a lot of
25:25
minimal work so these people they need
25:27
to really do some research I can
25:30
understand what are the important
25:31
keywords that need to be mentioned
25:33
what are topics so what I was project I
25:39
was doing was actually trying to help
25:43
these people to make their job easier to
25:46
instead of them going through all these
25:50
pages from Google we would do this for
25:54
them and then here are the keywords that
25:57
you should use because 10 out of 20
26:00
websites use this keyboard so for
26:03
example if you write about New York and
26:10
mentioned or time scorer and Time Square
26:12
is two words not just one word so this
26:15
is like allocation to words but they
26:19
mean one thing so trying to extract this
26:22
time to understand what is helpful what
26:26
needs to be mentioned that was the
26:28
project that was new and it was a great
26:32
success because they convinced the
26:33
clients of assessment ecstatic to use it
26:36
and they realized this so that it helps
26:39
think operators to great this was a very
26:44
exciting project for me because I liked
26:46
working with data and also at the same
26:50
time not just but actually taking and to
26:58
end distance ability from the beginning
27:00
of the project to actually deploying
27:02
this seeing how customers interact and
27:04
try to tweak it and they're making it
27:07
better this is really rewarding to to
27:12
watch and do and this was one of the
27:14
first successes of course there were
27:17
some other projects didn't go really
27:20
well for different reasons sometimes
27:24
just happens and I decide not to focus
27:27
to continue working or maybe don't use
27:34
it and then the project just dies or we
27:38
realize that we do something but it's
27:41
not so unfortunately the cases where the
27:50
project is exciting but it doesn't but
27:55
luckily there are those projects that do
27:58
make impact and this is really cool too
28:01
to think and down for me it's a good
28:04
memory it was four years ago and I still
28:08
remember about this project is yeah
28:13
that's that's a really cool story
28:16
basically like anybody out there that's
28:19
trying to come up with like a you know
28:21
something that would
28:23
working in the marketplace and actually
28:25
make money you know with your skills
28:26
like that's a really cool a really cool
28:29
concept that you just brought up I could
28:32
also argue it's like a career path like
28:35
becoming an expert so how did you how
28:38
did you kind of manage with I mean it
28:39
was a good experience you're not doing
28:41
it anymore but you got some some things
28:43
out of it that you were able to build on
28:45
top of like what is your like this
28:48
immediately is that when I hear that
28:50
story I'm like dude why did you just
28:51
keep doing that like that sounds awesome
29:20
company also marketing but from a it's
29:28
[Music]
29:30
when you play something you see these
29:32
annoying things so maybe one of them so
29:39
but then yeah I eventually ended up with
29:41
three weeks and many many people don't
29:45
know this is just like eBay on eBay if
29:52
the bidding but this is a place where
29:54
you sell stuff online classifieds
30:05
website even though many people from but
30:16
business is happening there yes this is
30:18
happening so this is I think it's still
30:21
the most popular online classified so
30:26
until exist even it doesn't
30:31
it's not Craigslist but there are some
30:34
markets were will exist present so not
30:38
in the States but for example in Poland
30:41
Ukraine or India and a lot of countries
30:46
actually it's how was present is pretty
30:50
global in some markets will exist
30:53
present under a different brand people
30:59
know it as it's also and then in online
31:06
classifieds there are many things that
31:09
machine during consult so one of the
31:12
things when I started working at least
31:14
the first thing I was working on was
31:17
determining if quality of an image is
31:20
good some people often want to sell
31:23
something and then they don't realize
31:25
that taking a good picture is important
31:29
if you want something all right if it is
31:32
or it isn't it is it's very ok yeah
31:35
yes because people want to see the thing
31:38
before deciding ok do you want to
31:40
contact the seller or not although
31:43
sometimes if price is low the quality
31:46
doesn't really that doesn't really
31:48
matter but if price is not that low and
31:53
then pictures bad and people we wanted
31:59
to help them to say hey perhaps you need
32:02
to do this in not in that complete
32:07
darkness or not not with direct sunlight
32:11
or something like this
32:14
so just to do to educate people how they
32:17
should take pictures to increase their
32:19
chances of selling things and this is
32:23
where was she doing I was helpful to you
32:25
to analyze images that again is too much
32:30
sun exposure what you're critiquing them
32:35
on like how to how to make the pet the
32:37
picture better and their photography is
32:40
that you
32:42
from work but total yeah like just
32:45
saying them educating them so no for
32:50
example if they want to sell something
32:51
and then after two weeks nobody
32:53
contacted then we think okay maybe
32:55
perhaps it's because pictures but let's
32:58
analyze pictures yes indeed this picture
33:00
is pretty bad so then we sent a campaign
33:03
like a mail to the seller okay please
33:07
consider taking this picture because in
33:10
this picture there are these problems
33:11
for example this is the objects not
33:14
properly centered and it's too dark
33:18
focus and then here is an instruction
33:22
however good initially and then after
33:24
these people would sign off them not
33:27
everybody but some of them would
33:28
actually follow the otherwise we take
33:32
pictures and then we would see that
33:34
indeed the number of contacts these
33:37
people started to receive their the
33:42
buyer started to be more interested in
33:45
the items that was one of the first
33:48
projects I worked and then I think my
33:57
question is pretty important is content
34:00
foundation so people can you cannot even
34:04
imagine what people try to sell or like
34:08
some some legal services or weapons or
34:12
drugs or just scamming if stuff for
34:15
gaming stuff of course here's like a lot
34:17
of fraud and typically what happens
34:22
there is the content foundation platform
34:24
and content foundation team that looks
34:26
at the content that users publish and
34:29
you judge thinks hey this is not a loan
34:32
to to to sell here you just bound to the
34:37
users try to indicated when for example
34:40
in non serious cases like maybe somebody
34:44
was trying to so cellphone and put them
34:48
into cars category okay
34:52
select innocent
34:54
but there are serious cases of fraud
34:56
where people for example still images
35:00
from good good listing then they post as
35:05
genuine scholars saying hey this is a
35:08
flat I'm trying to discover this is
35:10
Karen Francesco or this is her cellphone
35:13
and transistor and then somebody
35:16
contacts by a contacts and this thruster
35:21
tells hey
35:22
yeah but in front of you there are ten
35:24
other people who also want to buy this
35:25
cell phone but if you give me hundred
35:27
dollars I'll set it aside just for you
35:30
and then some people do hundred dollars
35:35
so this is I want you to prevent this
35:41
problem and this is what the content
35:44
validation team does and a lot of things
35:48
so for example one of the projects I
35:51
worked in duplicate this is activities
35:55
when somebody copies existing content
35:59
and tries to you to pose as a good
36:02
seller so this is the case where we can
36:05
detect this or maybe this user has other
36:11
accounts and by looking at the behavior
36:14
of these accounts like where they come
36:17
from what are the IDs
36:19
what time of the day they come from so
36:22
we can somehow class service accounts
36:24
and understand that they actually belong
36:26
to the same to the same person who
36:28
discovered et and then we can bound them
36:32
together at once so there's there are a
36:37
lot of opportunities to actually use
36:39
machine learning to make the job of
36:41
moderators easier because moderators
36:45
need to go through a lot of we want to
36:49
help them to somehow show them like okay
36:52
this is fine you don't even need to look
36:54
at this because this is just a pairs of
36:56
sauce that somebody wants to sell so
36:59
this is innocent so we don't even show
37:01
this to directors but in some cases hey
37:03
this looks like a gun is sure one
37:05
control that this is the gun and take
37:11
so this is actually the Confederation is
37:15
the place where I rushed learning
37:17
catalytics so this was the first
37:20
successful use case of machine learning
37:22
it was indeed viable and then from that
37:25
team yeah it's it was it was kind of
37:34
their gateway drug they're like okay we
37:36
need to be anybody with like a manual
37:38
process or if they feel like like
37:41
everybody is leveraging this technology
37:43
and they're more effective at their work
37:45
which i think is just my experience
37:48
doing these podcasts and talking with
37:50
people it's like there's a lot of fear
37:52
around this technology but it's actually
37:54
improving our tape like our ability to
37:58
live life at its fullest or whatever you
38:02
want to call it but when a moment is
38:32
needed the actual pilot of the plane
38:35
takes care of things so the same machine
38:40
learning is not true the model says
38:43
please review it for me and confirm that
38:46
there's just like yeah that's a cool
39:03
metaphor yeah I might even just you know
39:06
use that going forward as my metaphor
39:09
cool thanks for sharing that so I was
39:14
curious so you're writing this book
39:16
right now so and you you're kind of like
39:19
you
39:19
you understand very well like if you're
39:22
gonna produce content you go research
39:24
what people are looking for right now
39:26
so what patterns did you see and the
39:30
markets needs that triggered your idea
39:32
for writing so I so so that's something
41:06
[Music]
41:13
so some company prepares the data set
41:15
and then asks people can you train a
41:21
model for us and this is very hands-on
41:26
so you can immediately see feedback
41:30
because
41:31
little world you you have a model use
41:35
for the so called test data this is the
41:37
data for which you don't have you need
41:40
to generate predictions you upload these
41:42
predictions on a platform and you see
41:45
how well your model is doing so you get
41:47
feedback immediately so this is really
41:51
hands-on you like a lot of coding like
41:56
do you just click the model you try to
41:58
optimize pneumatic that you in the
42:01
competition and then you submit your
42:04
solution and so this is a lot of
42:10
projects so like each competition is a
42:12
project and for me personally this is
42:14
when I learned most so years University
42:20
to learn theory but this theory without
42:23
actually practice and to be honest
42:28
wasn't that needed to do these
42:30
computations so because these
42:32
competitions are really hands-on things
42:34
you just think a library you're flying
42:36
and try to tune parameters you think
42:37
I'll ever use right we have to state
42:39
here try this
42:41
please a lot of engineering work just
42:44
you have an idea you want to code this
42:46
idea in Python and then you test Expedia
42:50
works and this made me realize the the
42:54
best way at least for me but also for
42:56
many other people on cargo is not just
42:59
study a textbook but rather do things
43:03
just get a data set get my hands dirty
43:07
solve this problem and try to understand
43:11
what is there then it was me then just
43:16
you know watching call this equation so
43:24
that's why I think that this
43:28
project-based approach is the best
43:30
approach for people who are software
43:33
engineers who can code and that's why I
43:37
wrote this book so first of all its
43:39
Python because I think
43:42
cheering and then it's basically for me
43:46
personally
43:47
any people agree one of the best ways
43:51
yeah and and actually so just hearing
43:55
what you were saying there it's almost
43:57
like if because I've I've worked with
44:00
those Kol competitions before and
44:01
there's certainly a lot you can learn
44:03
just by seeing other people's work that
44:05
they submit and you're like oh
44:07
everybody's uploading this I wonder what
44:09
their methodology is and then you can
44:11
kind of learn from that but it kind of
44:13
there's still no like video tutorials or
44:16
something that you can watch on these
44:18
data sets so one might be able to argue
44:20
like if you are trying to perform better
44:23
as a kegel competitor for example your
44:27
your resource might that your the book
44:30
that you're writing is almost like built
44:32
on the pains that you had going through
44:36
this processes and so you're kind of
44:37
like this is going to be a resource it's
44:39
going to help you compete better it's
44:41
going to help you get jobs understanding
44:47
this well then great for us but yeah so
45:50
this is more targeted for people who
45:51
want to do well
45:55
okay yeah and that's at the end of the
45:57
day like we're trying to get these
45:59
skills we're trying to get paid that's
46:01
the mission yeah it seems like a cool
47:35
community like it's very collaborative
47:38
and like in like you might have like
47:40
that the highest performing score and
47:43
you go to bed and you wake up in the
47:44
morning and you're like position ten you
47:46
know like things are moving it's like
47:48
it's almost like a video game I don't
47:50
know it's yeah it's interesting so if
47:55
you if you have some time and you want
48:00
to spend somewhere
48:03
[Music]
48:07
difficult to to stop doing car yeah good
48:15
to know yeah that's that's good to know
48:18
I wanted to okay so you kind of alluded
48:20
to this like the difference between
48:22
Python and JavaScript and why you kind
48:25
of like went that way and I noticed on
48:28
your CV you had mentioned that you're
48:29
one of your gifts that you bring to the
48:32
world is that you are you are good at
48:36
rapid prototyping and so I was wondering
48:38
where do your rapid prototyping skills
48:41
get applied most often I'm just curious
48:43
like is it everywhere or you know is
48:47
that working what you can do is just sit
49:28
there look at the pictures and say okay
49:31
this picture is not good let's send a
49:33
mail to this seller and see how they
49:35
react so instead of investing into into
49:40
building the whole thing just take some
49:43
effort to validate this and then invest
49:57
this example looking things yourself and
50:05
then maybe have a spreadsheet with you
50:07
know who should send this user in email
50:10
but of course you can also automate this
50:12
and give something simple
50:18
- that baby doesn't always fall the best
50:22
engineering standards maybe instead of
50:24
three modules use of just one like you
50:27
Madame Rendell
50:29
but you as fast as possible you want to
50:32
validate something to see that this is
50:35
something users want or this is um
50:37
something that other stakeholders in
50:40
company think that they should invest on
50:42
so maybe they should convince not the
50:44
end users but first the decision makers
50:47
who decide which project to project then
50:53
to convince them somehow the best way of
50:57
convincing is not the PowerPoint
50:58
presentation of doors or sores but what
51:01
works better is a prototype where they
51:04
can actually click on things they see
51:06
how it works
51:07
and this is what I mean by prototype in
51:12
skills to be able to as fast as possible
51:14
to have that and so it means yeah yeah
52:02
man I okay so first of all like we're
52:05
about an hour into this I feel like I've
52:08
gotten my money's worth out of this like
52:10
what you're talking about is seriously I
52:13
don't know if it's just like the stuff
52:15
going on at my my work right now but
52:17
like this is so critical and we are
52:20
practicing this right now and it's so
52:22
exciting I think to know okay you know
52:24
in a week we're gonna know if this is if
52:27
this thing even has a future or not and
52:29
sometimes it's almost like a coach
52:31
thing like if the company culture I
52:33
don't know I it may it's very intuitive
52:36
to me but you talk to me a year ago I
52:39
don't know if like rapid prototyping is
52:42
something that I would you know seek out
52:44
as a skill on my team or even to build
52:47
on my own but holy cow it sounds like
52:49
it's one of the most important things
52:51
that you can yeah that's a really cool
53:48
framework to operate from what what do
53:51
you have maybe we already covered this
53:53
but just like off the top of your head
53:55
what are like three tips you have for
53:57
someone to become an expert at rapid
53:59
prototyping well just maybe time frame
54:06
so let's say I want to spend on this
54:11
only five days they want to do as much
54:14
as possible during these five days and
54:16
then like just like mindset so just try
54:22
to squeeze most out of yourself maybe
54:24
get some people to also work on this and
54:28
just one first time frame and not let it
54:35
you know take more time than initially
54:38
just one week and then it's hard so I
54:41
think it really helps you to think
54:44
we only have one week what is the most
54:47
important thing I need to focus on my
54:50
god yeah actually maybe I don't eat
54:51
other things so let's concentrate on
54:54
this one let's help this particular
54:57
thing working let's have a demo that
54:59
showcases this particular thing it helps
55:01
you also to understand what is the most
55:03
important thing dang so like so there
55:11
there's no more tips like if you take
55:13
that one and put it in the bank you're
55:15
good to go or do you have other tips
55:18
well I mean that's good I mean that's my
55:23
money's worth right there but I want to
55:26
pry a little more that's part of this
56:09
wonderful thing and then just play there
56:12
and then in Java that for me is the
56:24
concept of supernatural I was really
56:29
struggling to to start using them but
56:31
once I did start that was there was no
56:34
way so I think just using the language
56:39
with all these wonderful tools then I'm
56:45
trying to come up with 30 yeah maybe
56:50
just people who also want to to to help
56:55
you do this alone but
56:57
ten box and then have a few people to
57:00
help you also know that sometimes people
57:03
do this alone okay let me just post
57:06
myself in this room for a week and then
57:08
I'll have a brother to me
57:14
dang man
57:15
that's that's powerful I mean dang
57:18
there's so much gold there like yeah one
57:21
of you practicing this okay that's maybe
57:23
you can be productive but like a group
57:25
of like-minded people like that they
57:28
call that where it's like one plus one
57:30
equals three
57:31
it's like yeah in my head I already have
58:35
a solution but I don't always know how
58:43
why did I think it should be this way
58:46
okay having clear path like clear steps
58:54
explaining the steps this is something
59:04
then that's that
59:06
powerful so I won last part on this
59:08
rapid prototyping I must know okay so
59:11
you have maybe you like every year you
59:14
set your goals and you're kind of like
59:17
okay six months from now I want to be
59:19
here nine months from here I want to be
59:21
here but if you're practicing this rapid
59:23
prototyping and you're setting yourself
59:25
to maybe like a five day hard stop or a
59:28
15 or 30 day hard stop how do you like
59:32
my intuition tells me that it's good to
59:34
have long-term goals but you probably
59:36
learned so much through that process six
59:39
months down the line you realize how
59:40
Delusion delusional you were with like
59:43
what was appropriate goals you know six
59:46
months out how do you deal with that
60:01
[Music]
60:10
sometimes
60:36
yeah that's that's kind of like what is
60:38
the you know like the answer to life or
60:41
something like that maybe that's what
60:43
that question was so you did well you uh
60:45
okay cool man
60:47
um what do you recommend that does not
60:51
take too much effort but solves like 80%
60:54
of the challenge of becoming like a
60:58
kegel competition winner
61:00
[Music]
61:12
[Music]
61:18
and this is not even being in money was
61:20
I positive so only top three in money
61:24
but actually being like ending in top
61:27
ten is super difficult so this is
61:30
recognized in the community is a sign of
61:34
that's why they they have this cattle
61:36
master page saying that this person give
61:40
well in this recognizable thing and
61:45
unfortunately there is no easy answer
61:46
but practice and for the competition
61:48
that I did pretty well I started from
61:51
the beginning and then it lasted for
61:54
three months and almost every day I did
61:57
a little bit so just read forums we did
62:03
four on see what other people do try to
62:06
also to not get behind trying to
62:11
reproduce what they do maybe generate
62:12
some ideas pick the most promising one
62:15
try to implement this and also I think
62:17
sharing like change some things on
62:21
forums also helps because this creates
62:23
this community that if you share a
62:26
poster back so when you discover things
62:29
that really work and if you can get a
62:31
different it's still helpful to you know
62:34
to share these things so because then
62:36
others will share share back some other
62:39
hmm yeah but so it's really helpful for
62:45
like a year it was helpful for Mike a
62:48
year to spend this coffee here and try
62:53
to to do well there because immense
62:56
amount of knowledge there but it's also
63:00
a big time investment and then at some
63:03
point they realized I'm spending too
63:05
much time on this
63:06
what's so but probably the best the best
63:13
way of doing this is Pitcairn's
63:16
try to understand it and kernels are
63:19
often written by non-professionals of
63:22
engineers and trying to understand them
63:25
is often difficult so but still try to
63:28
figure out what's going on in this
63:30
camera
63:31
Five Forks and then also try to read
63:34
forums and then it should help you maybe
63:37
not end up in gold but this you remember
63:40
perhaps which is still a lot of
63:45
experience yeah I thanks for sharing
63:52
that so I I kind of I prep out some
63:56
framework for the questions of the
63:58
podcast and then I kind of go on these
63:59
rabbit trails as they pop up but after I
64:02
wrote that question down and as far as
64:04
our conversation has gone right now I
64:06
actually can't I like the answer that
64:08
you gave I think there will be an
64:10
audience that wants to hear that message
64:12
but I'm actually more genuinely
64:15
interested in like I think based on what
64:17
we talked about it's important to get a
64:19
job with your skills to get paid for
64:21
your skills so I actually if you last
64:24
let me ask like almost the same question
64:27
what do you recommend that does not take
64:29
too much effort but solves 80% of the
64:32
challenge of basically convincing
64:34
somebody that you are a good person to
64:37
hire as a machine-learning professional
64:41
or yes I find if you don't find it other
65:08
said try to build your own data set this
65:10
is difficult but but then also like once
65:20
you have this once you train a model
65:22
don't just don't let it just sit there
65:25
let the world know about this
65:27
so put the code on github write a postal
65:32
medium or then try to use social media
65:36
to somehow tell the world hey
65:41
please look and create awareness about
65:44
yourself and then I think if you do this
65:48
light for 10 projects you get noticed
65:52
for sure like especially if it was
65:55
somewhere like a good news or some
65:57
places like that yeah and there's a lot
66:00
of there are a lot of people who are
66:04
interested in this type of content and
66:09
when you learn it yourself and then also
66:11
try to teach others like this a lot of
66:16
people there's big audience of people
66:19
who want to also learn from this
66:22
experience
66:23
and also try to reproduce this project
66:26
and for them it would be very helpful
66:29
and for you okay
66:33
that's really solid thanks for sharing
66:34
that um what do you think is overly
66:37
difficult to master with machine
66:40
learning that newcomers should kind of
66:43
just up completely avoid well probably
66:49
at the beginning people should avoid
66:53
going too deep into theoretical
66:55
foundation especially with things like
66:59
support vector machines or there are
67:03
some certain algorithms that is solid
67:06
theoretical foundation but at the same
67:08
time it requires a lot of knowledge to
67:12
industry to be able to be able to
67:15
understand it so this support vector
67:18
machines for example acquire a few years
67:21
of calculus and you know a year of
67:27
convex optimization so like things that
67:30
are pretty difficult and at once and
67:32
people studied them in like third fourth
67:37
year of university people who major in
67:41
math for example so this is pretty
67:46
difficult and it might give you a sense
67:50
that I don't understand anything
67:54
so let's quit because it's not worth my
67:57
time to I can people when they see these
68:00
equations then just give up what don't
68:08
so don't let this equation sky because
68:13
there are libraries that you often don't
68:15
need to to to be afraid of what's inside
68:20
you just need to be able to use them
68:22
like like metaphor I use tools already
68:27
like you don't need to know how to cpa
68:31
these tech works to be able to create
68:33
obscurus so of course it's helpful but
68:36
for for a new climate certainly focus
68:40
should be on learning fast rather than
68:44
going deep into the mo so I think the
68:50
same to just stay at the problem like at
68:53
the right level of abstraction and for
68:55
the beginners it might be a library so
69:02
don't don't try to you to do from this
69:05
time maybe when the time comes
69:17
hmm that's all yeah that's awesome
69:20
don't don't try and peel the onion all
69:22
it all I want that's awesome there's so
69:25
much wisdom you know in that holy cow
69:28
okay yeah I love the whole condom with
69:30
your prototyping methodology it's about
69:33
this like you know being incremental
69:36
seeing if it works and super dynamic
69:39
like I know I asked you like what are
69:42
your morning routines you're like
69:43
whatever I need to do I'm pretty
69:45
adaptable to like whatever needs to be
69:46
done and I think that's the name of the
69:48
game man like what you're like them the
69:50
real core of your message is like just
69:53
you know focus realize that you have
69:56
these tendencies maybe that you might
69:58
try to get into the weeds or whatever
69:59
but just be proactive on not trying to
70:02
peel the onion be incremental or not try
70:05
and peel the onion all at once so
70:07
seriously man I'm resonating with your
70:10
message here so thank you let's see here
70:14
um let's see here okay so what is the
70:17
easiest way for someone to start
70:19
integrating the promises of Auto ml or
70:23
Auto machine learning into their
70:25
workflows like how can we do that
70:27
starting tomorrow yes this is think that
70:40
finding the best one so to use them you
70:46
don't really need much just tries to to
70:59
find the best model or there are some
71:03
libraries like optimization libraries
71:05
that lets you find the best parameters
71:12
to explore and then finally there are
71:15
companies like Google Amazon Microsoft
71:19
in the cloud and then you just have a
71:36
data set upload this data set and then
71:39
this thing figures out how to deal with
71:43
each type of a CSV and then we also need
71:51
to specific this cone is the target
71:54
the number or the category I want to
71:57
predict and then in figures out what to
71:59
do with the rest he trains the best okay
72:02
this is you can use it either in our
72:06
services or you can download it and use
72:08
it and then I think this is the best way
72:13
is just you go there to your favorite
72:15
local provider and just try to play
72:18
but over and see actually and observe
72:23
how easy it is to to use these things
72:26
and this is one of the other things I
72:31
mentioned that I enjoy seeing it as a
72:35
trend is that machine learning becomes a
72:37
commodity what more people can start
72:42
using it even without you know having a
72:45
proper mathematical background like
72:48
living PhD in mathematics or physics
72:51
like some some other complex subject but
72:58
simple people mere mortals somebody who
73:01
can code can already benefit immensely
73:06
from this services this can go ahead and
73:11
to solve real business problems and yeah
73:19
they eat so the ecosystem is kind of
73:21
matured to a point where there is no
73:23
excuses like you can get out there and
73:26
get your hands dirty and solve
73:27
real-world problems and you don't need
73:29
to be like some PhD genius like there's
73:32
no excuses if you want to get your hands
73:34
dirty you can it's kind of what I'm
73:36
hearing cool
73:38
yeah thanks for sharing that what are
73:42
three key learnings from your experience
73:45
running machine learning models in
73:47
production yeah so was spending too much
74:08
time on don't don't make the model
74:13
perfect just have something super simple
74:15
like a simple baseline and then try to
74:18
deploy it try to move with this
74:21
prototype in production like with this
74:23
baseline in production and then see how
74:26
people that don't make it overly complex
74:29
just a simple
74:31
just take some category and then compute
74:34
mean within each category for example if
74:37
you want to predict a price for an item
74:40
and just look at the mean price at the
74:43
average price in each category and then
74:45
just use that as prediction so something
74:48
super simple you see that all the car
74:52
this particular model like on average of
74:57
this price is this price situation don't
75:00
make a super complex model like in your
75:03
network or something
75:04
just go with simple things first try to
75:06
deploy that see how users react to this
75:09
see if they actually use it if they
75:12
don't stop because like after investing
75:17
a lot of time in any project this may be
75:22
another learn that people tend to have
75:27
difficulty stopping working on project
75:29
you know if you're at about this idea
75:32
effect if you built unto yourself you
75:34
little of it even if it's like for an
75:37
outsider it's like oh you know it's your
75:40
baby
75:40
yes exactly yeah oh man this is yeah
75:45
carry on
75:46
yeah yeah and then like for example you
75:49
view the desk or chair and this chair my
75:54
baby ugly thing the same thing happens
76:10
with people who must have this maybe
76:15
it's not super optimal and maybe just go
76:19
down but it's still like people invested
76:24
a lot of time into this and they have
76:25
troubles letting go and I know that I
76:31
myself like realizing this is helpful to
76:35
you know just to let go of things at
76:40
some point because
76:41
there's no point investing more time in
76:43
this but at the beginning like when you
76:46
spent only one week again comes back to
76:49
this prototype in skills like just have
76:51
a simple baseline and then if it doesn't
76:53
work it's easier to let it go because
76:57
you clearly see that your customer is
76:59
not super excited about this so it's not
77:02
something you expected to see you learn
77:04
that anymore yeah okay that's awesome
77:09
yeah thanks for sharing that
77:11
Oh what is a gentle approach to learning
77:14
more about kubernetes I know you're
77:16
excited about that technology well not
77:33
no you don't need to know into us but at
77:37
least concepts like what other things
77:40
and for that there is a thing called
77:42
mini tube so it's basically kubernetes
77:47
that you can just have your laptop and
77:48
then try to to deploy a simple service a
77:54
single service that did surprise my car
77:58
and then just get a mini cube instance
78:03
on your machine and try to deploy your
78:06
web service with this model in this will
78:12
not take more than five hours of your
78:14
time but this is super valuable to know
78:17
and then you won't get lost when you get
78:20
hired it turns out that the company used
78:25
for many people especially better
78:27
scientists this is something scary
78:28
okay I'm not used to these kind of
78:31
things this is not my mo not my thing so
78:38
they just afraid but kubernetes made it
78:42
very easy for people to actually to
78:48
abstract from these difficult things of
78:50
the scaling because what I like about
78:53
this makes
78:54
is super easy to work with
78:57
infrastructure infrastructure related
78:59
things so it's a very nice abstraction
79:01
on top of you know even AWS machines or
79:06
your own machines we don't use in the
79:10
videos but many companies still have
79:12
their own data centers there is a really
79:17
good abstraction to you for managing all
79:19
these machines and it's not difficult
79:23
for a user name is to learn how to use
79:28
it of course it's difficult for people
79:29
who are professionals like engineers
79:35
engineers this is basically to to
79:40
maintain posture but as a user doesn't
79:46
take too much time to actually learn how
79:47
to use it and they're good tutorials in
79:52
something like cube floor getting
79:54
started just follow this tutorial that
79:57
should be not to be helpful also not
80:03
wait till somebody with this knowledge
80:05
implement this because it's easy to
80:07
implement this yourself you shouldn't be
80:10
scared you can actually learn this cool
80:20
and it sounds like cube flow is kind of
80:22
like really like it's like the least
80:25
intimidating way maybe to go about cool
80:29
yeah flow is actually like there's me
80:32
and Cuban ladies and you just do to
80:35
learn about cube flow is another
80:41
abstraction for training okay Oh perfect
80:51
yeah yes so this is I'm still exploring
80:56
it to see how useful it is but many
80:59
companies
81:00
and saying that this is super useful
81:03
they can also like there are
81:08
alternatives to keep form like this so
81:12
called machine learning platforms where
81:13
you can train a model for example in
81:17
case of Amazon there is a wsh maker it's
81:21
quite a similar to for training and
81:24
hosting models and cue flow is cloud
81:33
agnostic so you can use it in any cloud
81:36
and you don't have to use cloud for that
81:39
he can just use your own servers your
81:41
own data center to also have the
81:44
benefits of this ok yeah that's awesome
81:48
and I'm gonna dig into that probably
81:50
well tomorrow cuz it's a it's getting a
81:52
little late here but yeah I'll be
81:54
digging into the the promises of cube
81:57
flow so thanks for sharing that I know
81:58
were kind of running how's your how's
82:00
your computer doing we got a few minutes
82:02
left
82:02
yes 10 minutes ok so these are just kind
82:10
of wind down questions so just whatever
82:12
comes to mind go ahead and I think I got
82:15
like 5 of them so I'm just gonna go for
82:16
it ok what qualities do you look for in
82:19
a good meet-up okay somebody who wants
82:50
to listen to so people and free food
82:56
helps no I I hear you there cool um how
83:02
do you decide what speaking
83:03
opportunities to take on well right now
83:07
I think
83:08
watch everything okay I don't have that
83:11
many speaking opportunities and I
83:12
practically seek to speak somewhere and
83:16
I still learn how to make my call for
83:19
proposal sound exciting so actually I
83:22
get to speak on conferences because I
83:25
often don't so right now I'm okay so you
83:33
I mean you made a promise to yourself
83:35
like I'm going to speak more and then
83:38
you're just you're it's almost like yeah
83:42
it's almost like there's a group of
83:44
people out there that are like sign me
83:46
up and then there's other people I've
83:48
just noticed this like booking people on
83:50
the podcast some people are like yes
83:52
please sign me up and other people are
83:54
like what's the nature of this and so
83:57
yeah the people I guess in their motives
83:59
but I was kind of curious what your what
84:01
was kind of behind your initiative there
84:03
and I look forward to promoting like if
84:06
you want more speaking opportunities I
84:08
look forward to help promoting that yes
84:12
[Music]
84:16
yeah
84:18
this is a real quick question relating
84:21
to speaking but I mean did it just come
84:24
natural to you or did you have to was
84:27
there some sort of like transformation
84:29
you went through that you have some
84:30
insight on now like how to be a good
84:32
speaker or what's what's your thoughts
84:35
on that so it's some confidence is
84:42
really go next and they want to make
84:46
sure that the quality of the
84:49
presentations I was very happy to get
85:00
something like this okay but yeah mostly
85:09
smells just natural so I think the the
85:12
main thing is to to have a coherent
85:14
story so not just a bunch of facts but
85:18
- to cover story there and and then also
85:26
one of the things I didn't do and then I
85:28
learned from the gorgeous is to make
85:33
sure the audience is never lost
85:35
so have every now and then have an
85:37
online and somehow summarize what we
85:40
just learned and what we got and then
85:43
and then have a summary so then people
85:45
leave the room with hear message in
85:48
their head
85:49
and for that somebody is very yeah
85:53
that's solid uh dang thanks for sharing
85:56
that that's cool man
85:59
let's see here three favorite learning
86:02
resources for machine learning we've got
86:04
the book well that's yeah okay well okay
86:18
even though it's even after okay cool
86:45
any other ones or those are your good
86:47
enough near unless for confusion
87:10
computer issues and it's quite demanding
87:17
course okay so peeling the onion maybe
87:25
don't start there but consider aces
87:27
legging
87:32
okay cool that's awesome all right
87:34
here's one for you yeah what is
87:59
important is solving business problems
88:02
and being able to to code to solve these
88:05
problems and don't be afraid of with the
88:08
baselines if you're if instead of
88:12
machine learning models model if they're
88:15
for my dream if statements it's equally
88:18
good so start with heuristics and then
88:23
if you see that cool yeah that's solid
88:29
man Thanks
88:31
okay the most important book you've ever
88:33
read and there's no there's no rules
88:36
here it could be like fiction well well
88:40
if you have I'm going for one but if you
88:42
got if you got more you know what's your
88:44
hierarchy of a couple of okay so the
88:46
first effective Java
88:53
okay active Java even though it's about
88:57
it's not just Java so it does use Java
89:01
but many things are quite quite general
89:04
so things like well especially as a Java
89:16
developers or some things directly
89:18
applicable to the things I was doing but
89:20
also teaching best practices best coding
89:22
styles and then explaining the divinity
89:26
matters it's a third safety good like
89:31
having good names all these things then
89:36
maybe
89:39
and interpretation of computer programs
89:40
may be heard about this one so this is a
89:43
beautiful book and I use this book to to
89:48
learn about functional programming so it
89:50
uses scheme which is idealism and just
89:57
reading it and then going through
89:59
exercises I think after this book I got
90:02
I understood what functional programming
90:04
is they could use this everywhere in
90:08
Java in Python and not be afraid of that
90:13
and also with time I realized not to
90:17
understood how to overuse this because
90:23
over two things but I think this
90:30
structuring the interpretation of
90:32
computer programs and is great
90:35
introduction to functional programming
90:37
then I think that just two years three
90:43
years ago was designing data intensive
90:47
applications this is a super nice book
90:50
and I think it's a must read for any
90:52
software engineer anyone who she teaches
90:57
basics of how to design your systems how
91:03
to make them reliable how to make them
91:05
available and then it also goes into
91:09
basics of date engineering like what is
91:11
my videos what is dreaming like this I
91:15
think I still use this book as a
91:20
reference sometimes they go to this on
91:22
my desk at home often just go through
91:25
this Octavia's now it's not very
91:28
demanding but it gives a great overview
91:30
of things that then it also references
91:37
like if you want to go deeper into some
91:41
topics and you okay cool yeah I've seen
91:46
that on the O'Reilly
91:47
that's one of the O'Reilly books it's
91:49
got like a pig or something on the front
91:51
like a board
91:53
yeah that's a okay that's a it's come on
91:58
my radar before but I now I'm very
92:00
interested just based on your okay
92:02
thanks for sharing that programming
92:06
languages to learn in you can just you
92:09
know I don't think job is yet I think
92:42
like just if you know during different
92:48
language like just to think differently
92:53
yeah then I also think in worrying but
92:58
JavaScript I think this is you really
93:02
need to know even if you for
93:13
demonstration for demo purposes like if
93:15
you want to showcase it to somebody then
93:18
service is the best like a page is the
93:21
best medium for that and then being able
93:24
to quickly catch something in JavaScript
93:26
to convey your message to people yes I
93:32
I'm old-fashioned so I don't watch I
93:38
don't follow the latest I would simply
93:46
suggest the languages that certainly
93:56
yeah they've stood the test of time yes
93:59
and they're still like a live type thing
94:01
is Java still the most book
94:03
which in the world according to some
94:05
witnesses yeah for some indices
94:09
JavaScript and I think knowing them is
94:14
also I think for machine learning
94:16
engineer Oh in a bit of sequence is
94:20
awful because as a Python user sometimes
94:24
things just sometimes we really need to
94:29
machine learning involves lot of number
94:31
crunching and this is where you don't
94:36
wait to for a web service to answer you
94:40
have CP intensive work and for that C is
94:44
the best thing sometimes it just helps
94:48
to quickly read something C and then use
94:52
it from path and then it can have a
94:55
dramatic effect on performance like
94:57
going from hours to minutes like from I
94:59
don't know from 60 minutes to maybe have
95:03
bright work for certain cases especially
95:06
when it comes to number 20 is still the
95:09
