# YouTube Transcriptions To CSV



If you have ever tried to copy transcription data from a YouTube video then you know when it is pasted the format is weird.

Now you dont need to worry because this package will parse that pasted data and place it into a structured 2-column format

Col1=Video Time Stamp
Col2=Video Transcript words

# Assumptions
- you have your raw data in a file called transcript.txt
- you ***do not** have a file named transcription.csv (remove this if you do have it)

# Usage
python transcriber.py
